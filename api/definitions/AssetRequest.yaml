    name: Iris Dataset
    description: 'This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher''s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.'
